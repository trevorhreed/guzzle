# ng-guzzle

This project helps me remove the gulp boilerplate from my AngularJS applications. You're welcome to use it, but I don't have any intention of writing documentation at the moment. There is, however, a partial example.

Ok, here are some reminders for myself:

```
$ guzzle
```

```
./src/
./www/
```
